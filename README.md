## Introduction

Understanding data structures and algorithms is fundamental for every programmer and plays a crucial role in writing efficient and optimized code. This repository serves as a resource for learning and implementing these concepts in various programming languages.

## Data Structures

In this section, you'll find implementations and explanations of essential data structures, including:

- [ ] Arrays
- [ ] Linked Lists
- [x] Stacks
- [ ] Queues
- [ ] Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
- [ ] Heaps
- [ ] Hash Tables
- [ ] Graphs (Graph representations, traversals, algorithms)
- [ ] and more...

Each data structure folder contains code examples and explanations of their operations, usage, and time complexity.

## Algorithms

Explore a wide range of algorithms for sorting, searching, and solving problems efficiently, such as:

- [ ] Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- [ ] Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.)
- [ ] Dynamic Programming
- [ ] Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra's, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, etc.)
- [ ] Greedy Algorithms
- [ ] Divide and Conquer
- [ ] Recursion
- [ ] and more...

The algorithm folders provide detailed implementations, explanations, and examples to help you understand and apply these algorithms.
