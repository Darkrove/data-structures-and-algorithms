# Stack Data Structure

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It is used to store and manage a collection of elements where the most recently added element is the first one to be removed.

## Key Information

- **Definition**: A stack is a collection of elements with two main operations: `push` (add an element) and `pop` (remove the most recently added element).
- **Operations**:
  - `push`: Add an element to the top of the stack.
  - `pop`: Remove and return the top element from the stack.
  - `peek`: View the top element without removing it.
  - `isEmpty`: Check if the stack is empty.
  - `size`: Get the number of elements in the stack.
- **Common Use Cases**:
  1. Function Call Stack: Managing function calls in programming languages.
  2. Expression Evaluation: Evaluating mathematical expressions.
  3. Backtracking Algorithms: Solving problems using backtracking.
  4. Undo/Redo Functionality: Supporting undo and redo operations in applications.
