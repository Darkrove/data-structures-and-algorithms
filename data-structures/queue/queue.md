# Queue Data Structure

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It is used to store and manage a collection of elements where the first element added is the first one to be removed.

## Key Information

- **Definition**: A queue is a collection of elements with two main operations: `enqueue` (add an element) and `dequeue` (remove the first element).
- **Operations**:
  - `enqueue`: Add an element to the rear of the queue.
  - `dequeue`: Remove and return the front element from the queue.
  - `peek`: View the front element without removing it.
  - `isEmpty`: Check if the queue is empty.
  - `size`: Get the number of elements in the queue.
- **Common Use Cases**:
  1. Task Scheduling: Managing tasks in a system in the order they arrive.
  2. Print Queue: Queuing print jobs in printers.
  3. Breadth-First Search (BFS): Exploring nodes level by level in graph algorithms.
  4. Waiting Lines: Handling customers or requests in a fair order.
